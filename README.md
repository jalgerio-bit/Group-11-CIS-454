# Here are the steps to run our application

1. Get the backend running
    First you need to run "pip install pandas flask flask-cors" in a command prompt

    You should be able to just run "python api_server.py" from the backend folder, but if that doesn't work you should use the commands "py -m venv venv", 
    followed by "venv\Scripts\activate" in a command prompt

2. Get the frontend running
    You need to have node.js in order to run our frontend, and all other dependencies should be taken care of when using the "npm start". Use that command in the frontend/src file in a terminal and the frontend will start running locally.
